# Annotation segmentation and removal 

Removes the handwriting detected by [Synthesis in Style](https://github.com/hendraet/synthesis-in-style) by using the [LBAM inpainting model](https://github.com/Vious/LBAM_Pytorch).

## Setup

Make sure you have the synthesis-in-style lightning files in /final_application/synthesis_in_style_lightning before installing it locally.
The requirements can be installed via pip and the requirements.txt file. 
Alternatively, you can use the docker image "docker://hendraet/synthesis-in-style:cuda-11.1".
Weights can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O_bImshs5KXloh2Nd05TzmiQIqIlJw0i/view?usp=sharing) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19daBLbYazgU6q2EaEdHudJqrkWSWYlqf/view?usp=sharing).


## Files:  

### fill_handwriting_with_background.py: 

Removes the handwriting from documents by replacing the handwriting with the mean value of the document.  
Usage: 
```
fill_handwriting_with_background.py --input-dir "directory of the documents with handwriting" --output-dir "output directory"
```

### remove_handwriting.py 

Removes the handwriting from documents by replacing the handwriting with the ouput of LBAM.  
Usage: 
```
remove_handwriting.py --input-dir "directory of the documents with handwriting" --output-dir "output directory"
```

### get_pnsr_and_ssim.py 

Outputs the pnsr, ssim, mse and l1-loss between two direcories with documents.
Usage: 
```
get_pnsr_and_ssim.py --ground-truth "directory with the ground-truth images" --removed-handwriting "directory with the inpainted images"
```
